# If not installed (check with apt list | grep openssh):
sudo apt install openssh-server openssh-client

# Known hosts and public keys:
  ~/.ssh/

## CLIENT:
# Check for existing keys:
    ls -al ~/.ssh

#  There must be a .ssh folder with file/file.pub files pairs

# Generating keys:
#  Ed25519 algorithm:
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
#  RSA algorithm (for legacy systems):
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

#  In both cases, enter file name and passwords

#  It generates two keys one private and one public (homonymous to private but with .pub extension)

# Add generated key to the ssh-agent:
#  Start ssh-agent:
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
#  Add private key:
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_private_key_filename

# Copy public key to remote server
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/your_public_key.pub your-username@remote-host
#  (Or got to servers web site and follow instructions)

# Test:
    ssh -T user@host

# Manage many ssh public keys:
#  Create more ssk key pairs

#  Configure ssh client:
vim ~/.ssh/config

#  Enter data (one full block by key):
# Host (enter IP)
#  HostName (enter host name)
#  User (enter username)
#  PreferredAuthentications (publickey, password or any other available)
#  IdentityFile (private key filename, relating to the public key copied to remote server)

# Example for GitHub:
#  Host and HostName: github.com
#  Test: ssh -T git@github.com

# Example for GitLab:
#  Host and HostName: gitlab.com
#  Test: ssh -T git@gitlab.com

## SERVER:
# Check for service:
sudo systemctl status sshd
 # or: sudo /etc/init.d/ssh status

# Start service (if stopped):
sudo systemctl start sshd
 # or: sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start

# Restart:
sudo systemctl restart sshd
 # or: sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart

# Stop:
sudo systemctl stop sshd
 # or: sudo /etc/init.d/ssh stop

# Check ports available:
ss -lpn

# Edit sshd_config:
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Port changed
# Listen Address 0.0.0.0
# SyslogFacility AUTH
# PermitRootLogin no
# PasswordAuthentication yes
# PermitEmptyPasswords no
# Banner none

 # Configure to the highest security
  # 1. Change port 22 to, i.e., 22445:
          ...
          # What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
          Port 22445
          ...

# Connect from other device with: ssh -p port-number user@host
